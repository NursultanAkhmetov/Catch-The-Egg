# Minesweeper

"Minesweeper" is my second game for the nFactorial Incubator 2023 program. By utilizing over 15 modules, I ensured readable and bug-free code. Pygame powers the game's graphics and user interactions, while the Google Sheets API stores scores for competitive ranking. Multiple difficulty levels and structured code provide an enjoyable and organized gaming experience. Uncover the mines and enjoy "Minesweeper"!
